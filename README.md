# Airfoil Bluetooth Remote

Remote Control of [Airfoil](https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) via Bluetooth. 

This is a remote control in a small Box with a [Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995) and three arcade buttons. Now I'm able to control play/pause and volume of Airfoil on a Mac Mini in a different room. Airfoil is streaming audio to all rooms via AirPlay.

Code is based on [iOS_switch_control](https://github.com/cyborg5/iOS_switch_control) from cyborg5.
